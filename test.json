    "Abstract": "We explored continuous changes in self-other identity by designing an interpersonal facial morphing experience where facial images of two users are blended and swapped over time. This study revealed a Self-Other Continuum in the context of agency and facial identity, enhancing our understanding of social and subjective aspects of interpersonal communication."
